          I&apos;m a 16 year old boy from Indonesia whose passion is to code
          useful things and do things that i like. I&apos;m currently being a
          student at SMAN 5 Kota Bekasi. I can make a fullstack website, a
          minecraft server, a discord bot, and many more. I have some done small
          projects and i usually made projects with my friends.
          <br />
          Some of my projects are for fun, but i want to focus on to be a better
          programmer soon. You can see my stacks and my projects below.
