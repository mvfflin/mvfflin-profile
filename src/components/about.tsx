        I&apos;m a 15 year old boy from Indonesia who likes to code for fun and
        do things that i like. I&apos;m currently studying at SMAN 5 Kota
        Bekasi. I can make a fullstack website, a minecraft server, a discord
        bot, and many more. I have some done small projects and i usually made
        projects with my friend{" "}
